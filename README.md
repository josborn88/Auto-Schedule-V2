# AutoShells V2, what it is
This is a small program I made to help create daily schedules for my workplace. It creates the shells, or the rough outlines for each day. The daily schedules are made in Excel and our weekly schedules are created with WhenIwork.com. This program scrapes the data from WhenIWork and adds it to the Excel documents. From there the shells are filled in based on who is trained on what activities we are doing that day. I am working on a program to fill in each day, you can find that project on my GitHub under AutoPops.

This is the second iteration I have made for this task. The first version was much longer at over 1000 lines of code. After learning more about Python and programming in general I went back and rewrote it, this being the result.
